# Distributed Integral Calculation
Given the function and the section to integrate, find the value of the integral using this computer's threads and also other computer's ones in local network. The time must decrease respectively 
to the number of threads independently of using different computers (considering they have same CPU's): 2 threads - time decreases by 2 times, 3 threads - 3 times and etc.
